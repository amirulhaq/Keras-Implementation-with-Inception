# Keras-Implementation-with-Inception
In this project, we will create a simple Kers implementation for object detection using Keras and Inception v3 Network. The goal of this project is to make a image classification algorithm. This project requires a Google Collaboratory account and a Google Drive account to support it. The datasets we use to train the pre-trained model are from Caltech Dataset Repository. We encourage you to learn more from this reference to understand this project:
